## 1) 3/0.05 = 60 or if using the chart you get 59. 

## 2) At 95% confidence at 1% prevalence in a large population (using infinite) we see that you would need a sample size of **299**. On the other hand, with a confidence of 99% at 2% prevalence you would need a sample size of **229**. So you woulkd need a smaler sample size becasue of the larger prevalence. 

## 3) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. none of the 300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is **<** (<,=,>,) **1%**.
